            Ahh, karaoke, my personal preference to deal with stress or when I
            simply want to relax. I don't have to much of a outside social life,
            however, I am an active member of an online karaoke community called
            Karaoke Central which I have now been part of since early august
            2019.

            I enjoy playing a variety of games, but primarily I spend my time
            playing 'League of Legends', 'Risk of Rain 2' and 'Civilization VI'.

            Videos and movies are fun to watch, I however prefer animations over
            any kind of live-action media entertainment and have probably
            watched anywhere between 350 to 400 different anime-styled series.

            While I really enjoy watching anime I have turned more and more to
            reading manga and have probably spent more time reading manga,
            manhwa and manhua. I am currently actively reading somewhere between
            100-150 differnt ones some of which are newly discovered whilst
            others are ongoing.
            <br />
            I do save up a few chapters from time to time to binge read later.
